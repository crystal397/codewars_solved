## Description

The marketing team is spending way too much time typing in hashtags.
Let's help them with our own Hashtag Generator!

Here's the deal:

It must start with a hashtag (#).
All words must have their first letter capitalized.
If the final result is longer than 140 chars it must return false.
If the input or the result is an empty string it must return false.
### Examples
```
" Hello there thanks for trying my Kata"  =>  "#HelloThereThanksForTryingMyKata"
"    Hello     World   "                  =>  "#HelloWorld"
""                                        =>  false
```

# Solutions
1. I solved the problem by **splitting the string into words, capitalizing each word, and then joining them together.**.
2. But I found a more efficient and readable solution.
   
### **1. Strip Leading/Trailing Spaces (Handling Edge Cases)**

- **Original Code**:
  - The original code doesn't handle leading or trailing spaces explicitly. If the input has extra spaces at the beginning or end, it still processes them and may cause issues.
  
- **Optimized Code**:
  - The optimized code uses `s.strip()` to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the string before processing it. This ensures that extra spaces won't affect the hashtag generation and that the string is clean before the main logic begins.
  - **Improvement**: This handles edge cases more reliably, especially when the user input contains unnecessary spaces.

### **2. Checking for Empty String and Length Check** 

- **Original Code**:
  - The original code checks the length of the joined string (`joinS`) after capitalizing the words. If the string is empty or too long (>= 140 characters), it returns `False`.
  - The code computes `len(joinS)` first and checks if the length exceeds 140 characters.
  
- **Optimized Code**:
  - In the optimized code, after stripping, it first checks if the string is empty or if its length exceeds the 140-character limit. The condition is now written as `if not stripped_s or len(stripped_s) + 1 > 140`, which checks for an empty string after stripping and ensures the length doesn't exceed 140 characters after including the `#` symbol.
  - **Improvement**: By performing the check earlier in the process and cleaning up the string first (`strip()`), the optimized code avoids unnecessary computations (like capitalization and joining) if the string is invalid.

### **3. Capitalization of Each Word**

- **Original Code**:
  - The original solution uses a list comprehension: `[i.capitalize() for i in splitS]`. It capitalizes each word in the string and then joins the list of words together.
  - The capitalization method is applied to every word, but this approach might not be as efficient, especially when dealing with larger strings because it requires creating a list of capitalized words and then joining them together.
  
- **Optimized Code**:
  - The optimized code uses a **generator expression** inside the `join()` method: `''.join(word.capitalize() for word in stripped_s.split())`. This approach is more memory efficient because it doesn't create an intermediate list but generates the words on the fly as it processes them.
  - **Improvement**: The use of a generator expression in combination with `join()` can be more efficient than using a list comprehension because it avoids creating and storing an intermediate list. This reduces memory usage and can be faster, especially with large inputs.

### **4. String Concatenation Optimization**

- **Original Code**:
  - The original code uses `''.join(splitS)` to concatenate the words into a single string. While this is generally efficient for small cases, for larger strings, repeated string concatenation might become more time-consuming.
  
- **Optimized Code**:
  - The optimized code also uses `''.join(...)`, but it combines it with a generator expression to process the words one at a time. This makes the operation more efficient and faster when the string grows larger.
  - **Improvement**: Using a generator expression in conjunction with `join()` optimizes the concatenation process because it minimizes intermediate memory allocation.

### **Summary of Improvements in the Optimized Code**:

1. **Whitespace handling**: It strips leading/trailing spaces before proceeding with processing.
2. **Early validation**: The empty string and length check are done early, preventing unnecessary computations if the string is invalid.
3. **Efficient string construction**: It uses a generator expression with `join()` instead of creating an intermediate list, making the code more memory-efficient and faster.
4. **Cleaner logic**: The optimized code has a simpler, more readable structure with less repetition of similar logic.

### **Performance Difference**:
- In the case of large inputs, these optimizations result in a **noticeable performance improvement** as you've observed. The **memory efficiency** and **early exits** (e.g., checking the string length upfront) reduce unnecessary operations, leading to faster execution time for large datasets.
